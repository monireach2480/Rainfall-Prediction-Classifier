# Rainfall Prediction Classifier - Final Project

This project builds a machine learning classifier to predict rainfall in Australia using weather data from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology.

## Project Structure

- `FinalProject_AUSWeather.ipynb`  
  Main Jupyter notebook containing all code, analysis, and results.
- `image.png`  
  Example result image showing model output (see below).


## Objectives

- Explore and perform feature engineering on real-world weather data.
- Build a classifier pipeline and optimize it using grid search cross-validation.
- Evaluate model performance using various metrics and visualizations.
- Implement and compare different classifiers.

## Data

The dataset is loaded directly from:  
[Australian Weather Data CSV](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/_0eYOqji3unP1tDNKWZMjg/weatherAUS-2.csv)

It contains daily weather observations from multiple locations in Australia.

## Usage

1. **Install dependencies**  
   Required libraries:  
   - numpy  
   - pandas  
   - matplotlib  
   - scikit-learn  
   - seaborn

   Install with:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
   ```

2. **Open and run the notebook**  
   Open `FinalProject_AUSWeather.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code and run the cells sequentially.

3. **Follow the exercises**  
   The notebook guides you through data loading, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and interpretation.

## Results

- The best model is a Random Forest classifier, optimized via grid search.
- Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and feature importances.
- The most important feature for predicting rainfall is typically `Humidity3pm`.

### Example Output

Below is a sample result image generated by the notebook:
